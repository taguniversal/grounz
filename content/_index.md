# Welcome to the circular economy renaissance.

Traditional recycling struggles to keep up—but upcycling coffee grounds into functional materials diverts waste before it enters the plastic stream. From exfoliating scrubs to durable coffee cup lids, every product replaces petroleum-based plastic with something smarter. This is effective recycling: cleaner inputs, fewer outputs, and a smaller footprint.

**Groundz** is a new initiative turning spent coffee grounds into useful products for everyday life — from natural pesticide-absorbing soil blends and exfoliating body scrubs, to biodegradable packaging materials.

By choosing products made from upcycled coffee, you’re doing your part to make the world a little cleaner, softer, and more sustainable. Small decisions add up, and your cup of coffee doesn’t have to end in the trash.

# Coffee Cup Lids

Globally, over 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed every day (according to stats from the International Coffee Organization and similar sources).

Even if just 10% of those are takeaway with lids, that’s still 225 million lids per day.

Multiply that by 365 days, and you get ~82 billion plastic lids per year.

Even scaling that down just to the U.S.:

Americans drink about 400 million cups of coffee daily.

Let’s say 30% are to-go with lids — that’s 120 million lids per day, or ~44 billion a year.

Breakdown:

Total global plastic production: ~400 million metric tons/year

Coffee cup lids: ~82 billion/year

~1.5g each = ~123,000 metric tons = 0.123 million tons

At just over 120,000 tons per year, coffee cup lids may seem like a small slice of the plastic economy — but that’s the equivalent weight of 12 Eiffel Towers, or enough lids to pave a 2-lane highway from New York to Los Angeles with plastic. When you picture it like that, even the smallest daily habit can become a mountain of waste.

# Body Scrub

Exfoliation with a Conscience
After brewing, used coffee grounds are carefully sterilized and dried, removing any residual moisture and contaminants. The result? A clean, eco-friendly exfoliant that can be blended seamlessly into spa-grade body scrubs. Rich in texture and gentle on skin, these grounds provide the satisfying scrub action people love—while reducing organic waste. Spas don’t need to change their formulas—just swap out the microplastics or synthetic grit for something more grounded.
